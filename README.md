## 🧠 Behind the Scenes

This project was born out of a curiosity to bring astrological self-discovery into a modern, beautiful, and shareable experience. Instead of offering full chart readings like traditional astrology tools, it focuses on **your elemental balance** — a powerful but often overlooked aspect of your birth chart.

Using chart.js and a combination of astrological logic, the app interprets your dominant element and provides a snapshot of what it says about you.

- 📬 Email-based PDF reports
- 🏹 Integration with other metaphysical tools (modalities, triplicities)

- 🌐 i18n (multilingual support)
